122A/EECS116 FinalProject

In this project, you we implemented a command-line program to manage the Agent platform. 

The Python can 
1) accept command-line arguments as the inputs, 
2) parse the inputs into SQL statements,  
3) execute the statements in the MySQL server, 
4) handle and print the results.
